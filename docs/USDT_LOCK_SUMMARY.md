## 🚀 How to Deploy & Test (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Create `.env` File
```bash
cd contracts
echo PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key_here > .env
```

### Step 2: Get Test Tokens
- **MATIC:** https://faucet.polygon.technology/ (for gas)
- **USDT:** You need at least 5 USDT on Polygon Amoy

### Step 3: Deploy Contract
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-locker.js --network polygonAmoy
```

### Step 4: Update Contract Address
Copy the deployed address and paste in:
`cryptobazaar/src/components/LockUSDTButton.tsx`

Line 18:
```typescript
const USDT_LOCKER_ADDRESS = "YOUR_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS_HERE";
```

### Step 5: Test in App
```bash
cd ../cryptobazaar
pnpm dev
```

1. Visit http://localhost:3000/exchange
2. Connect MetaMask (Polygon Amoy network)
3. Click "Lock 5 USDT (1 Hour)"
4. Approve both MetaMask popups
5. Success! 🎉

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Transfer failed" | Approve USDT spending first |
| "Insufficient funds" | Get more MATIC or USDT |
| Wrong network | Switch to Polygon Amoy in MetaMask |
| Contract address not set | Update USDT_LOCKER_ADDRESS in component |
| Transaction stuck | Wait or check PolygonScan |
