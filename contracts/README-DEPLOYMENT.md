## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Setup Environment Variables

1. In the `contracts` folder, create a `.env` file:

```bash
cd contracts
```

2. Add your private key to `.env`:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key_here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:**

- NEVER commit this file to Git (it's already in .gitignore)

**How to get your private key:**
- Open MetaMask
- Click the 3 dots ‚Üí Account Details
- Click "Show Private Key"
- Enter your password
- Copy the key (without `0x`)

### Step 2: Get Test Tokens

#### Get MATIC (for gas):
1. Visit: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
2. Select "Polygon Amoy"
3. Paste your wallet address
4. Request tokens

#### Get USDT (for locking):
You need at least 5 USDT. Options:
- Circle USDT Faucet (if available)

- Ask in community Discord

### Step 3: Deploy the Contract

**Option A - Using PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
cd contracts
.\deploy.ps1
```

**Option B - Manual Commands:**
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-locker.js --network polygonAmoy
```

### Step 4: Save the Contract Address

After deployment, you'll see output like:
```
‚úÖ USDTLocker deployed to: 0x1234567890abcdef...
```

**COPY THIS ADDRESS!** You'll need it for the next step.

### Step 5: Update Next.js App

1. Open: `cryptobazaar/src/components/LockUSDTButton.tsx`

2. Find this line:
```typescript
const USDT_LOCKER_ADDRESS = "YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
```

3. Replace with your actual contract address:
```typescript
const USDT_LOCKER_ADDRESS = "0x1234567890abcdef..."; // Your address here
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Error: "Transfer failed. Make sure you approved the contract."

**Solution:** You need to approve the contract first. The component handles this automatically, but if you see this error:
1. Refresh the page
2. Try clicking the lock button again
3. Make sure you confirm BOTH MetaMask popups

### Error: "Insufficient funds"

**Solutions:**
- **For USDT:** You need at least 5 USDT. Get more from faucet.
- **For Gas:** You need MATIC for transaction fees. Get from Polygon faucet.

### Wrong Network

**Solution:**
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the network dropdown
3. Switch to "Polygon Amoy"
4. If not listed, add it manually:
   - Network Name: Polygon Amoy
   - RPC URL: https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/
   - Chain ID: 80002
   - Currency: MATIC
   - Explorer: https://amoy.polygonscan.com/

### Transaction Stuck

**Solution:**
1. Wait a few minutes (Polygon Amoy can be slow)
2. Check on PolygonScan if transaction is pending
3. If truly stuck, try increasing gas in MetaMask

## üéØ Next Steps

After successfully locking USDT, you can:

1. **View Your Locks:** Add a display component showing all active locks
2. **Withdraw Feature:** Add a button to withdraw after unlock time
3. **Custom Lock Duration:** Let users choose lock duration
4. **Multiple Tokens:** Support ETH, other ERC20 tokens
5. **Escrow System:** Build full P2P trading with dispute resolution

## üîí Security Notes

1. **Never commit `.env`** - Your private key should NEVER be in Git
2. **Use test funds only** - This is a testnet, don't use real money
3. **Audit before mainnet** - Get the contract audited before deploying to mainnet
4. **Test thoroughly** - Test all functions before using with real users
